# It is a Mukbang for Leetcode 🍲

### **[1] Two Sum** ✅☕
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

### **[2] Add Two Numbers** ✅☕
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

### **[9] Palindrome Number** ✅☕
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

### **[13] Roman to Integer** ✅☕
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

### **[26] Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array** ✅☕
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

### **[27] Remove Element** ✅☕
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

### **[49] Remove Element** ✅☕
Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### **[53] Maximum Subarray** ✅☕
Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum. The O(N) solution is called Kadane's Algorithm.

### **[69] Sqrt(x)** ✅🐍
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well. You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

### **[169] Majority Element** ✅☕
Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### **[217] Contains Duplicate** ✅☕
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

### **[242] Valid Anagram [242]** ✅☕
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### **[1929] Concatenation of Array** ✅🐍
Given an integer array nums of length n, you want to create an array ans of length 2n where ans[i] == nums[i] and ans[i + n] == nums[i] for 0 <= i < n (0-indexed). Specifically, ans is the concatenation of two nums arrays. Return the array ans.
