### **[1] Two Sum** ✅
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

### **[2] Add Two Numbers** ✅
You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

### **[9] Palindrome Number** ✅
Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

### **[13] Roman to Integer** ✅
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

### **[27] Remove Element** ✅
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

### **[53] Maximum Subarray** ✅
Given an integer array nums, find the subarray with the largest sum, and return its sum. The O(N) solution is called Kadane's Algorithm.

### **[217] Contains Duplicate** ✅
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return false if every element is distinct.

### **[242] Valid Anagram [242]** ✅
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise. An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.
